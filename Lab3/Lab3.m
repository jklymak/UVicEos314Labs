%% 1. ONC / VENUS data
%%
% We'll now switch to looking at a set of data from the Ocean Networks
% Canada VENUS project from 18 Sep 2018 that I have downloaded for you.
% Later in the lab, you'll download your own data!
%
% We will be looking at the temperature, salinity and pressure for 18 Sep 2018 from the
% VENUS station in Saanich Inlet. *Note:* The mat files you will be working with
% have been downloaded for you from the Ocean Networks Canada website
% http://oceannetworks.ca/
%
% VENUS provides data in a MATLAB format called a *structure*. We will be
% using structures extensively to provide data to you. Structures are a way
% of packaging data into a saved data file. Below, |data| is the structure
% and it contains many pieces of information, including data and quality
% control flags. There is another structure, |metadata|, which contains
% information relating to the sensor that acquired the data.
% 
% The definition of a |structure| <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html from MATLAB>:
%
% *Structures:* Arrays with named fields that
% can contain data of varying types and sizes. A structure array is a data
% type that groups related data using data containers called fields. Each
% field can contain any type of data. Access data in a structure using dot
% notation of the form structName.fieldName.
% 
% The are two main pieces of information in the ONC data structures that 
% we will be working with:
%
% * |dat|: this corresponds to the sensor measurements. In the case of the
% data I have downloaded for you, this is either temperature or salinity.  
% * |time|: the timestamps that correspond with each value in |dat|
%
% Let's first take a look at the temperature data for 
% 18 Sep 2018 from the VENUS station in Saanich Inlet (~96 m depth). 
% 
%
%%

clear %all previous variables are now cleared from memory.

load('PatriciaBay_SaanichInletVENUSInstrumentPlatform_variables_SeaWaterTemperature_20180918T000001Z_20180918T235901Z-NaN_clean')

%%
% Have a look at your workspace window. You now have two entries: |data| and
% |metadata|. Both are structures. Notice the icon, and also the Value: _1x1
% struct_. 
%
% To see what is packaged inside the structure, you can simply type
% |data| at the command prompt.

data

%%
% Notice how much information is packed inside that structure! There are 32
% different fields, some of which are just information (e.g. |data.units|), and
% some of which contain numbers...
%%
% What is the timestamp on the first data point in the data set?

datestr(data.samplePeriodDateFrom)

%%
% All datasets downloaded from Ocean Networks Canada will have this same
% format and will follow the same naming conventions. We can tell what data
% is in the file by looking at |data.sensorName| and the data can be found in
% |data.dat|
%%
% Let's look at the first three values of data.dat
data.dat(1:3)
%%
% These are temperatures, and the units are found in |data.units| ('C'). What
% about the first three values of |data.time|?
datestr(data.time(1:3))

%%
% Now let's load the salinity data file.
load('PatriciaBay_SaanichInletVENUSInstrumentPlatform_variables_Salinity_20180918T000001Z_20180918T235901Z-NaN_clean') % units are PSU


%%
% *NOTE*: we still only have two structures in the workspace! Because all
% of the ONC data has the same naming convention, every time you load a datafile
% you will OVERWRITE the old data. Thus, since we are working with multiple measured
% parameters, we need to load the data for the measurement of interest, make
% a copy of the data we want to use, before loading the next data file.
%
% To make a copy of the data we want to use, first we load the structure
load('PatriciaBay_SaanichInletVENUSInstrumentPlatform_variables_SeaWaterTemperature_20180918T000001Z_20180918T235901Z-NaN_clean'); % units are deg C

%%
% Then we pull the data out of the structure by making new arrays called 
% |time| and |temp|:

time=data.time;
temp=data.dat;

%%
% This way, when we load the next ONC datafile, we will still have the
% temperature data available in our workspace. Another advantage to
% this is that we are also essentially creating a shortcut... For example, 
% |time| is much shorter to type than |data.time|, but they both now contain
% the same values.
%
% Next, we can re-load the salinity data file, and copy the 
% salinity data into a new array called |sal|:


%%

load('PatriciaBay_SaanichInletVENUSInstrumentPlatform_variables_Salinity_20180918T000001Z_20180918T235901Z-NaN_clean'); % units are PSU
sal=data.dat;

%%
% *NOTE:* I've only made one copy of the |time| data since I know all these files
% have exactly the same time information. I specified that I wanted all
% files to start at midnight on 18 Sept and continue until midnight on 19
% Sept. Each data file has 1440 entries - that's 1 sample per minute for 24
% hours.

%% 2. Subplots - a way to visualize data on the same timescale
% Since we know these data have the same time scale, let's plot them with
% one right above the other, so the two x-axes line up exactly. We can do
% this using subplots.
%
% From the MATLAB documentation: |subplot(m,n,p)| divides the current figure
% into an m-by-n grid and creates an axes for a subplot in the position
% specified by p. MATLABÂ® numbers its subplots by row, such that the first
% subplot is the first column of the first row, the second subplot is the
% second column of the first row, and so on.
%
% Let's create a set of time series plots with both variables (T,S) against
% time. We want to make sure to label all appropriate axes and try to make our plot
% as "readable" as possible.

figure (3) % opens a figure window
clf % clears the contents of the current figure window

%Define a plot space - there will be two rows, one column, and this will be the first plot
subplot(2,1,1) 
plot(time,temp)
datetick('x',15) % what do the inputs on datetick mean?
ylabel('T [^oC]'); % what does the "^" symbol in this expression do?
axis tight

subplot(2,1,2)  % What plot does this specify?
plot(time, sal)
datetick('x',15)
ylabel('Salinity [psu]');
xlabel(datestr(datenum(time(1,:)),1)) % what does "datestr" do?
axis tight

%% 3. How do I download my own data from ONC? 
% I've provided you with two data files - containing temperature and
% salinity. But I'd like you to look at four properties - T, S, DO, and P.
% 
% Go to https://data.oceannetworks.ca/DataSearch
%%
% In the _*Sort by*_ dropdown menu, select _*Properties By Location*_. 
%
%%
% Navigate to: 
% *Pacific* > *Salish Sea* > *Saanich Inlet* > *Patricia Bay* > 
% *Saanich Inlet VENUS Instrument Platform* > *Pressure*
%
% Then click the RED _*Select Data Product*_ link over on the right side of your screen. 
%
% We want the Pressure data, in _MAT 7_ format. 
%
% Enter the time range of interest: 
%
% _Date From (UTC):_ 18-Sep-2018  00:00:00
%
% _Date To (UTC):_ 19-Sep-2018 00:00:00
%
% You have 9 different options for the format of your data, sorted into 3
% groups. We want to download data from the *Time Series Scalar Data* group. There are 4 
% options: |.csv|, |.mat|, |.txt|, and |.json|. We will use MATLAB, but you may wish to
% use a |.csv| file if you want to use Excel for example.
%
% There are also *Time Series Scalar Plots* that are plots made by VENUS, 
% either as a png or pdf file. These plots are good if you just want a 
% quick graphical view, but if you actually want to examine the pressure data,
% you'll need to choose one of the data formats.
% 
%
%%
% Under the *Time Series Scalar Data*, choose _MAT 7_, the MATLAB Version 7 |.mat| file. 
%
% Click the red _*Add to Cart*_, and then click _*Next*_, then _*Checkout
% All*_.
%
% The file will be generated for you (wait a minute or two!) and a link
% will show up on the right of the page. We want the |.mat| file, not the
% Metadata (though that's interesting, too.) Click on the file name and
% download it to your computer. Put it into a directory that you can find
% and rename it to something that makes sense to you. I'll use
% |SepP.mat| for mine. Make sure you keep the |.mat| extension.

%% ASSIGNMENT
%
% *Part 1: Subplotting Figures*
%
% Go to the ONC site and download oxygen and pressure data sets to match
% the times of the temperature and salinity already provided. (see
% instructions in Part 3 above). 
%
% Make a set of subplots from the Saanich Inlet VENUS Instrument Platform
% data for 18 Sep 2018 (i.e. the data files from section 1). Your subplots
% should contain the temperature data, salinity data, oxygen data, and
% pressure anomalies plotted versus time. Make sure to label all
% appropriate axes and try to make your plot as "readable" as possible.
% Insert your figure into a Word document. Add a caption to the figure
% describing the subplots and where the data came from (i.e. Figure
% 1:....). Be sure to include a sufficient amount of detail here - where
% are the data coming from? what depth? Define any abbreviations or simple
% calculations you have done. Don't use |title| for this - there's not
% enough room to write a good figure caption. Rather, add the text in Word.
% 
% Below the figure, answer the following questions about the data:
%
% *Q1*. Go online and find information about the Ocean Networks Canada Saanich
% installation (the ONC website is a good place to start). Describe the location/environment of the Saanich Venus Instrument
% Platform, highlighting the node we are using in Patricia Bay and how it
% relates to the bathymetry of Saanich Inlet. Be specific - describe the location
% of the platform in Saanich Inlet. Do you think data obtained from the
% Patricia Bay node is representative of the conditions in the whole of Saanich
% Inlet? Why or why not?
%
% *Q2*. Look at the pressure anomaly data. What signal are you seeing in
% these data/what does the variation in the data represent? Describe the
% curve. What is the range of these data; the period? Remember - these data
% are obtained by a stationary CTD mounted to the bottom of the ocean.
%
% *Part 2: Code* 
% 
% Below your answers to questions 1 and 2, put a copy of the code you used to produce
% your figures. You can just cut and paste your code into Word.



%% NOTE
% You will be marked on 1) your answers to the questions; 2) the appearance
% of your figures - do they tell a story, and tell that story well?, 3)
% your ability to follow directions; and 4) the elegance of your code. Keep
% things neat and organized. Use % to make comment lines to explain what
% you are doing. Use the semicolon ; after commands to supress unnecessary
% output. Make sure you follow the file name conventions I've asked for.
%
% You need to hand in 1 file to the Lab 3 assignment dropbox on Brightspace: 
%
% * |Lab3Yourlastname.doc| : a *WORD document* containing your figure, the
% answer to questions 1-2, and a copy of the code you used to produce
% your figures. (Just cut and paste your code into Word).
