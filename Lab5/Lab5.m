%% Objectives
% Today, we will continue to learn about MATLAB while also looking at the
% regional conditions surrounding our cruise area. We'll learn how to make
% one kind of map and start playing with lots of colour!
%
% Review commands in today's lab: find
%
% New commands in today's lab: 
% * pcolor, contour, caxis, colorbar, hold, text
% * Use of colormaps
% * Setting the path (making the /common directory visible to MATLAB)
%
%
%% 1. Geography of the Area - Bathymetry
% What about the bathymetry? We've all seen the map in the lab... but could
% you produce your own? 
%%
% Here we will examine a few ways of looking at 2-D data.  We start
% with bathymetry because most people have seen plots like this
% before. One caveat, we will not use a real geographic
% projection here. For now, we just want to see how to visualize 2-D data.
%
clear

load BCregion_sm.mat

%%
% Have a look at the data contained in BCregion.mat. Your workspace
% now has a three variables |z|, |lat|, and |lon|. Notice that all three
% variables are 2-dimensional arrays. 

%%
% Use the |pcolor()| command to visualize the data.  Don't forget axis
% labels.  Also, add a |colorbar()|. Use |help pcolor| to see how to use
% the command - you'll need three variables: x, y, and z. In this case, our
% x values will be longitudes, our y values latitudes, and the z values are
% the elevations. 
%
figure(1);clf


% You will need to call |shading flat| to get rid of the black lines
% covering your plot:
shading flat   %shading interp also works here
% Also, because this isn't actually a map, we need to fix the aspect ratio
% to look more like a geographic projection. Use the following line in ALL
% your map plots: 
set(gca, 'dataaspectRatio', [1 cos(49*pi/180) 1]) % use this command on all your map plots!

%% 
% You can define what colours are used to display the data. If you don't
% specify, MATLAB uses the default colormap "jet", usage: colormap(jet)

%%
% Those colours are pretty funky for bathymetry.  We can change
% colormaps with the |colormap()| command.  The default colormap is
% |jet|. What does |flipup| do?
colormap(flipud(jet))

%%
% Play with some others. They are in the "common" directory in your MATLAB
% folder. 
% MATLAB should know how to find that directory (it's in the _path_), so to use
% them, you just have to type in the name as in the examples above. If the
% common directory is greyed out in the directory listing, right click on
% it and select "add to path". 
%
% Jody wrote one called |seajmk3| that is fairly good for ocean plots... 
% colormap(seajmk3)



%%
% Also, you can change the limits of the color axis, to help zoom in on the
% areas of interest:
caxis([-500 0]); % what depth range does this emphasize?

%%
% By carefully working with colormaps and the |caxis| command, you can show
% just the part of the data set that you are intertested in!
%% 
% Another way to look at the data - use the |contour| command. Contour
% takes 3 arguments, lon,lat, and z.   
% Remember to add a colorbar. 

figure(2); clf

set(gca,'dataaspectratio',[1 cos(49*pi/180) 1])

%%
% You could specify what contours to use. You can put in a 4th argument to
% specify the contour intervals, but MAKE SURE you read the help
% information for how to use contour! Calculating contour intervals is very
% time-consuming and will bog down your computer!  
% Remember to add a colorbar. 
% You could also add labels to your contours, using the command |clabel|. 

v=[-200 -100 0 100 200];  %make a matrix of the contours you want
figure(3); clf
[C,h]=contour(lon,lat,z, v);
set(gca,'dataaspectratio',[1 cos(49*pi/180) 1])
clabel(C,h)
colorbar

%% 2. What if we only want the area where the cruise took place? 
% We need to zoom in on Saanich Inlet. To do so, we can use the |find|
% command to find all the data points in the dataset that correspond to
% certain conditions. |find| will find the indicies of the data - that is,
% it finds the data's "place in its array".
%
% What are the bounds of the area we want to map? Latitude? Longitude?
%
% See if you can figure out the find commands and the relational operators
% you need to take a subset of the BCregion_sm data set.
%
% Put your commands here that will take a subset of the data:



%%
% Now use |pcolor()| to produce a bathymetric map of Saanich Inlet. 
% figure(4);clf;
% 
% shading flat

% Can you figure out a way to outline the coast a bit better? You could do
% it with the data set we have using the contour command. Another option is
% in another data set - SViCoast.mat. See if you can figure out how to use
% the variable |ncst| and the |plot| command. 
hold on
%
%don't forget axis lables, title, and a colorbar. 

%% 3. Overlay two data sets on one plot using hold
% Can you figure out a way to add a text label to the figure (using code,
% not the text box overlay function on the figure editor window!)?
%
% If you try to add another data set to a figure, you'll overwrite what's
% already there. So you need the |hold| command. Just put the command _hold
% on_ after your first plot command, then put your second. 
% 
% The plot we have made above using pcolor is a defined x-y space, with x
% being longitude and y being latitude. We have used |plot| to put data
% onto an x-y space before... so you could try overlaying a |plot| command
% on top of this map. You will need the |hold| command. However, |plot|
% only uses symbols... what about text? Guess what? The function you want
% is |text|. Type |help text| to see how this function works.
%
% text(-123.4, 48.2, 'Hello') 
% 
%%
% You could add the stations we visited to your bathymetry plot, making it
% into a map of our study area. The station locations from our 202409 cruise are
% available in StationLocation.mat


%
%% Lab 5 Assignment
% Hand in 1 file named Lab5CodeYourLastName.m containing the code to
% generate the figures listed below, and a comment under your code to
% answer Q1. Make sure that your code will run (and use the data files that
% I have given you, so that I have them too!). 
%
% Two figures, using appropriate colormaps, labels, captions, etc: 
%
% 1. Close up of the bathymetry and topography of our study area (Saanich
% Inlet, Satellite Channel, Haro Strait). Use |find| to limit the data in
% BCregion_sm.mat and plot only the data you need for your close up plot.
% This map must show the stations we visited on our 18 and 25 Sep 2024 cruises.
%
% 2. Regional map, to put the location of Saanich Inlet into context. You
% should limit the data in this plot too, to include only the areas you are
% likely to reference in your final project. Do you need the deep Pacific?
% Or merely Juan de Fuca Strait?
% 
% 
% *Q1*: Write a description of the geography of the study area, referring
% to features you see in your figures and that you think might play a role
% in controlling the oceanography of the Saanich Inlet area. Be specific in
% your description, being sure to reference approximate values
% (depths/elevations).


%% NOTE:
% You will be marked on 1) your answers to the questions; 2) your ability
% to follow directions; and 3) the elegance of your code. Keep things neat
% and organized. Use % to make comment lines to explain what you are doing.
% Use the semicolon ; after commands to supress unnecessary output. Make
% sure you follow the file name conventions I've asked for. 
%
% You need to submit 1 file to the dropbox on Brightspace:
%
% * |Lab5CodeYourlastname.m| with your code and answer to Q1
