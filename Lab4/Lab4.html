%% Lab 4: Setting the Stage - Regional Conditions Part I
% 
%% Objectives
% Today, we will continue to learn about MATLAB while also looking at the regional 
% conditions surrounding our cruise area. We will visit the ONC-VENUS website 
% and investigate some of the data available there.
% 
% To help put the cruises in context, we will look at meteorology data.
% 
% We will use two different ways to limit our data: |axis| and |find| - a very 
% powerful tool!
%% 1. Meterological Data
% Meteorological data are available from two reliable locations near our study 
% area. The Ocean Networks Canada Inshore Profiling System at Yarrow Point has 
% meteorological data including wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, 
% and barometric pressure. You can download those data from the ONC webpage (see 
% the section below on tides for more info on how to download data from ONC).
% 
% Another great source of meteorological data is airports... and conveniently, 
% we have one right in the middle of our study area! I've downloaded the meterological 
% data at the Victoria Airport during the time period of 1 September - 1 October 
% 2024. The main website is at: <http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/hourly_data_e.html?StationID=51337 
% http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/hourly_data_e.html?StationID=51337> 
% and you can work your way through it to find data for many different weather 
% stations in Canada.
% 
% I've put the met data into a _mat_ file called _met2024.mat_.
% 
% Load this data. What is the size of the array? How many columns of data are 
% there? Note there is a second array called |met_colheaders| that contains the 
% column headers.
% 
% Unlike the ONC-VENUS data sets, this mat file is NOT a structure. It's an 
% eight column array, with the columns arranged as:
% 
% Time(UTC) Temp(oC) DewPoint(ToC) RelHum(%) WindDir(10's deg) Wind Spd(km/h) 
% Visibility(km) AirPress(kPa)
% 
% You'll notice there are two columns for wind: strength(speed) and direction. 
% The wind direction variable is in 10's of degrees.
% 
% Also note that the time is in UTC.

clear
load ('met2024')
%% 
% You can make a new variable _time_ and another _windsp_ if you'd like, by 
% using the commands:

time = met2024(:,1); % time is the 1st column of met2024
windsp = met2024(:,6); % wind speed is the 6th column of met2024, (km/h)
winddir =met2024(:,5); % wind direction is the 5th column, (10's of degrees)

% Note - you could also just always specify met2024(:,1) every time you
% want to use the |time| variable, rather than pulling the values out of
% the matrix.
%% 2. Tutorial: Using only part of the data set
% This data set contains hourly measurements for the entire month of September. 
% What if I only want to plot the data from a couple of weeks? Let's look at the 
% two weeks prior to (and including) the first cruise (Sep 4 to Sep 19).
% 
% Here are two methods:
% 
% *1.* Use the |axis| command to specify what section of the data to plot
% 
% OR
% 
% *2.* Take a subset of the data using the |find| command, and then plot it.
% 
% For both options, you will need to tell MATLAB what is the first time you 
% are interested in plotting, and what is the last.
% 
% We can specify the first time that we want to plot by typing:

firsttime = datenum(2024,9,4) %start at midnight on Sep 4th
%% 
% and the last time that we want to plot:

lasttime = datenum(2024,9,19)  % midnight on the 20th - i.e. the time right after 11:59:59 pm on the 19th
%% 
% We've just created two new variables - _firsttime_ and _lasttime_ - that contain 
% the time of the first and last record we are interested in.
%% 2a: the axis command
% Start by taking a look at |axis| by typing |help axis| at the command prompt. 
% If you don't like this version of help, you may also try clicking on the blue 
% "Reference page for axis" at the bottom. Always scroll down in the help files 
% to see the worked examples - they are often much easier to understand!
% 
% Today, we will be using |axis| to limit how much of the data on a plot is 
% visible. First, we make a plot including all the data. Then, we call the |axis| 
% command and tell MATLAB exactly which data to show. Our usage will be axis([xmin 
% xmax ymin ymax]). Note the round brackets, which specify an arguement for axis, 
% and the square brackets, which indicate a maxtrix (a 1x4 vector in this case). 
% The order is important - you must put the four values in order (minimum x value, 
% maximum x value...).
% 
% Using the |axis| command, plot the wind speed as a timeseries for the two 
% weeks prior to (and including) the first cruise (Sep 4 to Sep 19). Plot wind 
% speed in green.

figure(1); clf
plot(time, windsp, 'g')
%axis ([ first time to plot, last time to plot, lowest windsp, highest windspeed])
datetick
ylabel('')  %give name and untis
xlabel('')
%% 
% A couple things to note using the axis command:
% 
% 1. You are still plotting all the data, so if you have a really large data 
% set, the plot can take a lot of time to generate. If you want to show a small 
% part of a large data set, it is much better to limit the *data*, not just the 
% *plot*! (See |find|, below).
% 
% 2. Sometimes |axis| doesn't play nice with |datetick|...
%% 2b. the find command
% And the second method - using the |find| command. This is a powerful command 
% that we will come back to again - so do make sure you understand it by the end 
% of this lab!
% 
% Let's look at some relational operators:
% 
% > is greater than
% 
% < is less than
% 
% <= less than or equal to
% 
% Some operations on a vector :

x = [11  0  33  0  55]';

find(x) % finds all non-zero values of x and returns the indices of their positions.

find(x == 0) % finds all _zero_ values of x

find(0 < x & x < 10*pi) % finds all values of x that are greater than zero, but less than 31.4...
%% 
% Back to our wind speed plot...

% We can specify the first time that we want to plot by typing:
firsttime = datenum(2024,9,4) %start at midnight on Sep 4th
%% 
% And the last time that we want to plot:

lasttime = datenum(2024,9,19)  % midnight on the 20th - i.e. the time right after 11:59:59 pm on the 29th
%% 
% Now we'll use the |find| command to locate all the (non-zero) elements of 
% time that fall between our start and end points. |find| will give us the _indices_ 
% of those times (not the times, themselves). It gives us the place in the array, 
% not the value.

inds=find(time>=firsttime & time<lasttime); % take out the ; here to see the output!
%
%% 
% How many wind speed measurements are there between our start and end times? 
% Does this make sense? (Hourly measurements for 14 days... )
% 
% OK - now we've created an array called |inds| and given it the value of all 
% the indices that fall in between our start and end points. The equation above 
% says:
% 
% inds = all the indices where time is greater than or equal to our firsttime 
% and less than our lasttime.
% 
% How do I ask MATLAB for only SOME values of an array, not all of them? I say 
% x=(1:3) to get the first three values, right? I could also say x=(variable name 
% that contains all the ones I want)...

time(inds) ;  % this will give me all values of time that fit the criteria I gave above!

%windsp(inds);
%winddir(inds)*10; % what is the *10 doing?
%% 3. Wind plots
% Let's make some timeseries plots of the wind data. Remember to add all your 
% axis lables. Try making the speed as a cyan line and the direction as green 
% +'s. Remember to use |help plot| to see the formatting options.

figure (3);clf;
subplot(2,1,1) % plot wind speed vs time here for our short dataset
plot(time(inds), windsp(inds))
datetick('keepticks', 'keeplimits')
xlabel('date/time')

% kdatetick % here's a special function that Jody gave me. I like this one sometimes!
% If you get an error message, make sure that the "common" directory is in the MATLAB path.


subplot(2,1,2) % plot wind direction vs time here, using points, not lines.
%% 
% That wind direction plot above is a little odd... it's hard to look at angular 
% data on a straight plot like that! There are ways to use MATLAB to produce other 
% kinds of plots, but that is beyond the scope of the tutorial.
% 
% Have a look at the figure you made... From what directions did the wind blow 
% the most frequently?
%% 4. Download the VENUS Saanich Node pressure data
% We need to look at the tidal data during and prior to our cruise. The pressure 
% record at the bottom of Saanich Inlet can be used as a proxy for tidal height.
% 
% Start with Choose Variable By Location, and navigate to Pacific/Salish Sea/Saanich 
% Inlet / Patricia Bay / Saanich Inlet VENUS Instrument Platform / Pressure Then 
% click the RED "Select Data Product" link over on the right side of your screen.
% 
% We want the Pressure data, in MAT 7 format.
% 
% Enter the time range of interest - download a month's worth of pressure data:
% 
% Date From (UTC): 1-Sep-2024 00:00:00
% 
% Date To (UTC): 1-Oct-2024 00:00:00
% 
% Select Data Format: Here you have 7 options: 2 of them are for plots made 
% by VENUS ? good if you just want a quick graphical view. But if you actually 
% want to examine the pressure data, you'll need to choose one of the data formats. 
% We will use MATLAB, but you may wish to use a .csv file if you want to use Excel, 
% for example.
% 
% Choose MATLAB Version 7 mat file.
% 
% Click the red "Add to Cart", and then click "Next", then "Checkout All."
% 
% The file will be generated for you (wait a minute or two!) and a link will 
% show up on the right of the page. We want the |.mat| file, not the Metadata 
% (though that's interesting, too.) Right-Click on the file name and download 
% it to your computer. Put it into a directory that you can find and rename it 
% to something that makes sense to you. I'll use |Sep24P.mat| for mine. Make sure 
% you keep the |.mat| extension.
%% 5. Load the data using MATLAB.
% Look at the current directory tab ? and double click on the .mat file. Now 
% change to the Workspace tab? it should show two structures in the Workshpace, 
% |data| and |metadata|. Click on |data| and the Variables window will open, showing 
% the large amount of information in the data structure.
% 
% ONC has set up their download data products to come with all the information 
% you might need. We know the dates, the quality flag information, what sensor 
% the data came from... and most importantly, there are two parts of the structure 
% that contain the data we want.
% 
% Note that ONC provides times in the UTC timezone.
% 
% The data are in two fields |data.time| and |data.dat|. The data in |dat| is 
% our parameter of interest, in this case, pressure.
% 
% Another way to load the data is from the command line.

clear
load('Sep24P.mat');  % or whatever file name you gave your downloaded file
%% 
% To see what the structure contains, just type the name of the structure.

whos  % this shows us what variables are in memory: we see there is a variable named "data"
%%
data
%% 
% Typing the name of the variable shows us that it is a "structure" - it contains 
% many different kinds of information, tucked away into different parts of the 
% array.
% 
% To access the different parts of the structure, we can type the structure 
% name followed by . followed by the next deeper piece of the structure. Here's 
% the first three entries in |data.dat|:

data.dat(1:3)  %units are decibar
%% 
% To make the data easier to work with, you could rename the variables to have 
% nice, short, understandable names but it's often better to leave the data in 
% the structure.
%% 6. Plot the pressure data
% Plot the time vs pressure data for Saanich Inlet for the 21 days prior to 
% and including Sep 25. This will give us a good picture of what's going on in 
% the Inlet during the time around our cruise. Use your knowledge of plotting 
% in MATLAB to add appropriate titles, legends, axis labels, etc. Try making the 
% line in red this time... with a line thickness of 2. You can use either |find| 
% or |axis| to limit your data.

figure (1) % opens a figure window
clf % clears the contents of the current figure window

plot(data.time,data.dat)
datetick
%% 
% Investigate the various options for |datetick| and |datestr|. There are many 
% format codes available. Make sure you choose appropriate formats for your xticks 
% and xlabel... Anyone looking at your figure needs to be able to understand when 
% the data are from.
% 
% Think about other methods you could use to look at these data... Are you going 
% to be comparing various data sets? Would subplots be appropriate?
%% Lab 4 Assignment
% Hand in 2 files:
% 
% *1.* Hand in a file named Lab4CodeYourLastName.m that contains the code to 
% make all required figures below. You must use |find| for at least one of the 
% two datasets (wind, pressure)
% 
% *2.* Also hand in (don't print out) a Word document named Lab4YourLastName.doc 
% containing the specified figures and answers to the questions below. Make sure 
% all figures are clearly labeled!
% 
% *Part 1*. Winds
% 
% Figure (use subplots) showing winds (both speed and direction) at the Victoria 
% Airport for two weeks prior to and including the Sep 25 2024 cruise.
% 
% *Q1*: Describe the general pattern in the winds. Were they strong or weak? 
% Give an estimate of their magnitude. Did they change over time? What direction 
% did they blow? Were they different in the days before each cruise or fairly 
% similar?
% 
% *Q2*: Why are we concerned with the winds in our study area? What effect(s) 
% do you anticipate seeing in our physical data (CTD)?
% 
% *Part 2*. Tides (from VENUS pressure data)
%
