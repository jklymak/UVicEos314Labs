<h2 id="1">Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this lab is to get you started using the MATLAB computer program. MATLAB is widely used software, and it can be used to solve a variety of numerical problems, from solving equations to plotting graphs, fitting curves to data points, and processing statistical data.</p>
<h2 id="2">Source</h2>
<p>You should be able to open and edit the file that made this html document. From within MATLAB, open Lab1.m (Do not just double-click the file from an Explorer window). You may either type <tt>edit Lab1.m</tt> at the command line or you can double-click on the filename in the <i>Workspace</i> window. This kind of file is sometimes called an "m-file" or a "script". It is a series of instructions that the computer will follow. Any line that starts with a % is ignored by the program. We use these lines as "comment" lines, to allow us to annotate the code with words so we can easily see what each section does.</p>
<p>During the labs, you will likely need to keep 2 programs running: MATLAB (icon on desktop) and a browser set to the webpage for the lab. For an internet browser, we suggest Chrome, Safari or Firefox over Microsoft Edge. You may also wish to look at the online MATLAB tutorial pages at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html">http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html</a>
</p>
<h2 id="4">1: Online tutorials</h2>
<p>Mathworks has some great tutorials on getting started with MATLAB. See <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials/launchpad.html">http://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials/launchpad.html</a> and <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/academia/students.html">http://www.mathworks.com/academia/students.html</a>
</p>
<h2 id="6">2. Arithmetic Operations and Functions</h2>
<p>At its simplest, we can use MATLAB as a calculator. In the command window, at the command prompt, type</p>
<p>3+2</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<pre class="codeinput">3+2
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     5

</pre>
<p>Type</p>
<p>3*7</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<pre class="codeinput">3*7
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    21

</pre>
<p>We can also do more complicated operations, like taking exponents: for "3 squared" type</p>
<p>3^2</p>
<pre class="codeinput">3^2
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     9

</pre>
<p>For "two to the fourth power" type</p>
<p>2^4</p>
<pre class="codeinput">2^4
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    16

</pre>
<p>"Scientific notation" is expressed with "10^" replaced by "e" - that is, 10^7 is written 1e7 and 2.15x10^-3 is written 2.15e-3. Examples:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">1.5e-2
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    0.0150

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">2e-3 * 1000
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     2

</pre>
<p>MATLAB has all of the basic arithmetic operations built in:</p>
<pre>         +   addition
         -   subtraction
         *   multiplication
         /   division
         ^   exponentiation</pre>
<p>as well as many more complicated functions (e.g. trigonometric, exponential):</p>
<pre>         sin(x)  sine of x (in radians)
         cos(x)  cosine of x (in radians)
         exp(x)  exponential of x
         log(x)  base e logarithm of x (normally written ln)</pre>
<p>The above are just a sample - MATLAB has lots of built-in functions.</p>
<p>You can always get help in MATLAB by typing "help". Type this alone and you'll get a big list of directories you can get more information about - not always too useful. It's more useful to type "help" with some other command that you'd like to know more about. E.g.:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">help <span class="string">sin</span>
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput"> SIN    Sine of argument in radians.
    SIN(X) is the sine of the elements of X.
 
    See also ASIN, SIND, SINPI.

<h2 id="15">3. Variables In MATLAB</h2>
<p>MATLAB can be used like a calculator - but it's much more. It's also a programming language, with all of the basic components of any such language.</p>
<p>The first and most basic of these components is one that we use all the time in math - the variable. Like in math, variables are generally denoted symbolically by individual characters (like "a" or "x") or by strings of characters (like "var1" or "new_value").</p>
<p>Any numerical quantity given a symbolic "name" is a variable. NOTE: Variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE; that is, "myvariable" is a different name than "MyVariable"</p>
<p>How do we assign a value to a variable? Easy - just use the equality sign. For example</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a = 3
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
a =

     3

</pre>
<p>sets the value 3 to the variable a. As another example</p>
<pre class="codeinput">b = 2
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
b =

     2

</pre>
<p>sets the value 2 to the variable b. We can carry out mathematical operations with these variables: e.g.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a+b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     5

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">a*b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     6

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">a^b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     9

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">cos(a)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

   -0.9900

</pre>
<p>There are some built in variables; one of the most useful is pi:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">pi
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    3.1416

</pre>
<p>We can also assign the output of a function to a new variable: e.g.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">b = a*exp(a)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
b =

   60.2566

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
b =

   60.2566

</pre>
<p>If you just want MATLAB to assign the value of a calculation to a variable without telling you the answer right away, all you have to do is put a semicolon after the calculation:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">b = a*exp(a);  <span class="comment">% note: the semicolon at the end surpressed the output</span>
</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
b =

   60.2566

</pre>
<p>Being able to use variables is very convenient, particularly when you're doing a multi-step calculation with the same quantity and want to be able to change the value. For example:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a = 1;
b = 3*a;
c = a*b^2;
d = c*b-a;
</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">d
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
d =

    26

</pre>
<p>Now say I want to do the same calculation with a = 3; all I need to do is make one change</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a = 3;
b = 3*a;
c = a*b^2;
d = c*b-a;
</pre>
<p>How does this make things any easier? Well, it didn't really here - we still had to type out the equations for b, c, and d all over again. But we'll see that in a stand-alone computer program it's very useful to be able to do this.</p>
<p>In fact, the sequence of operations above is an example of a computer program. Operations are carried out in a particular order, with the results of earlier computations being fed into later ones. You will be writing your own programs in a later section of the tutorial.</p>
<p>It is very important to understand this <b>sequential structure</b> of programming. In a program, things happen in a very particular order: the order you tell them to happen. It's very important to make sure you get this order right. This is pretty straightforward in the above example, but can be much more complicated! (see Lab 5, Flow Control)</p>
<p>Any time a variable is created, it's kept in memory. This can be useful - you can always use the variable again later. It can also make things harder - for example, in a long program you may try giving a variable a name that you've given another one earlier in the program, leading to confusion.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">
<span class="comment">% Let's see what is MATLABs memory by typing</span>
whos
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">  Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes

  a         1x1                 8  double              
  ans       1x1                 8  double              
  b         1x1                 8  double              
  c         1x1                 8  double              
  d         1x1                 8  double              

</pre>
<p>or, you can look in the <i>Workspace</i> window.</p>
<p>It can therefore be useful sometimes make MATLAB forget about a variable; for this the <tt>clear</tt> command is used. For example, define</p>
<pre class="codeinput">b = 3;
</pre>
<p>Now if we ask what b is, we'll get back that it's 3</p>
<pre class="codeinput">b
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
b =

     3

</pre>
<p>Using the clear command to remove b from memory</p>
<pre class="codeinput">clear <span class="string">b</span>
</pre>
<p>now if we ask about b</p>
<p>b</p>
<p>??? Undefined function or variable 'b'.</p>
<p>we're told it's not a variable in memory - we've succeeded in getting rid of it. To get rid of everything in memory, just type</p>
<pre class="codeinput">clear <span class="string">all</span>
</pre>
<p>Have a look over in the <i>Workspace</i> corner of your MATLAB window. All the variables we've already created are gone!</p>
<h2 id="37">4: Matrices / Arrays</h2>
<p>An important idea in programming is that of an array (or matrix). This is just an ordered sequence of numbers (known as elements):</p>
<pre class="codeinput">x = [1;2;3]

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 0]

<span class="comment">% Notice that the rows of a matrix are separated by semicolons, while the</span>
<span class="comment">% entries on a row are separated by spaces (or commas).</span>
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
x =

     1
     2
     3


A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     0

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1 22 -0.4]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

    1.0000   22.0000   -0.4000

</pre>
<p>M = [1, 22, -0.4] is a 3-element array in which the first element is 1, the second element is 22, and the third element is -0.4. These are ordered - in this particular array, these numbers always occur in this sequence - but this doesn't mean that there's any particular structure to the ordering. That is - in an array, numbers don't have to increase or decrease or anything like that. The elements can be in any order - but that order partly defines the array. Also note that the numbers can be integers or rational numbers, or positive or negative.</p>
<p>While the elements of the array can be any kind of number, their positions are identified by integers: there is a first, a second, a third, a fourth, etc. up until the end of the array. It's standard to indicate the position of the array using bracket notation: in the above example, the first element is</p>
<p>M(1) = 1</p>
<p>the second element is</p>
<p>M(2) = 22</p>
<p>and the third element is</p>
<p>M(3) = -0.4.</p>
<p>These integers counting off position in the array are known as "indices" (singular is "index").</p>
<p>All programming languages use arrays, but MATLAB is designed to make them particularly easy to work with (the MAT is for "matrix"). To make the array above in MATLAB all you need to do is type</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1 22 -0.4]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

    1.0000   22.0000   -0.4000

</pre>
<p>To enter a matrix, just follow a few basic conventions:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>separate the elements of a row with blanks or commas</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>use a semicolon, ;, to indicate the end of each row</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Surround the entire list of elements with square brackets, [ ].</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Remember that MATLAB always looks at rows first, then columns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Then to look at individual elements of the array, just ask for them by index number:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M(1)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     1

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M(2)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    22

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M(3)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

   -0.4000

</pre>
<p>We can also ask for certain ranges of an array, using the "colon" operator. For an array M we can ask for element i through element j by typing</p>
<p>M(i:j)</p>
<p>E.g.:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M(1:2)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     1    22

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M(2:3)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

   22.0000   -0.4000

</pre>
<p>If we want all elements of the array, we can type the colon on its own</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M(:)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    1.0000
   22.0000
   -0.4000

</pre>
<p>We can also use this notation to make arrays with a particular structure. Typing</p>
<p>M = a:b:c</p>
<p>makes an array that starts with first element</p>
<p>M(1)=a</p>
<p>and increases with increment b:</p>
<p>M(2) = a+b, M(3)= a+2b, M(4) = a+3b, etc.</p>
<p>The array stops at the largest value of N for which M(N) &lt;= c.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = 1:1:3
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

     1     2     3

</pre>
<p>The array starts with 1, increases by 1, and ends at 3</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1 : 0.5 : 3]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

    1.0000    1.5000    2.0000    2.5000    3.0000

</pre>
<p>The array starts at 1, increases by 0.5, and ends at 3</p>
<p>Example 3:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1:0.6:3]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

    1.0000    1.6000    2.2000    2.8000

</pre>
<p>Here the array starts at 1, increases by 0.6, and ends at 2.8 - because making one more step in the array would make the last element bigger than 3.</p>
<p>Example 4:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [3:-0.5:1]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

    3.0000    2.5000    2.0000    1.5000    1.0000

</pre>
<p>This kind of array can also be decreasing.</p>
<p>If the increment size b isn't specified, a default value of 1 is used:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1:5]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M =

     1     2     3     4     5

</pre>
<p>That is, the array a:c is the same as the array a:1:c</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the elements of an array can be any kind of number, the indices must be positive integers (1 and bigger). Trying non-positive or fractional integers will result in an error message. (Try it ...)</p>
<p>Each of the elements of an array is a variable on its own, which can be used in a mathematical operation. E.g.:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M(1)+M(3)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     4

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M(2)*M(3)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     6

</pre>
<p>The array itself is also a kind of variable - an array variable. We need to be careful with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiaion) when it comes to arrays - these things have to be defined correctly. We'll look at this later.</p>
<p>In MATLAB, when most functions are fed an array as an argument they give back an array of the function acting on each element. That is, for the function f and the array M, f(M) is an array such that</p>
<p>f(i) = f(M(i)).</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a = 0:4
b = exp(a)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
a =

     0     1     2     3     4


b =

    1.0000    2.7183    7.3891   20.0855   54.5982

</pre>
<p>Let's now try a 2-dimensional array. Type the following command into the command window:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 16 1]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
A =

    16     3     2    13
     5    10    11     8
     9     6     7    12
     4    15    16     1

</pre>
<p>MATLAB displays the matrix you just entered. We named this matrix <tt>A</tt> and it is now stored in the <i>Workspace</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>Subscripts</b> The element in row <tt>i</tt> and column <tt>j</tt> of <tt>A</tt> is denoted by <tt>A(i,j)</tt>. For example, <tt>A(4,2)</tt> is the number in the 4th row and the 2nd column. What is the value at <tt>A(4,2)</tt>? Type the command at the command prompt.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">A(4,2)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    15

</pre>
<p>What if we want a list of all the elements in the 2nd column? We use the colon, :, to indicate all the row values (in this case).</p>
<pre class="codeinput">A(:,2)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     3
    10
     6
    15

</pre>
<p>When you do not specify an output variable, MATLAB uses the variable <tt>ans</tt>, short for <i>answer</i>, to store the results of a calculation. <tt>ans</tt> will get over-written each time you do not specify an output variable.</p>
<p>Let's make a new matrix called <tt>X</tt> (also known as a vector if it only has one column) that has only the values from the 2nd column of A.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">X = A(:,2)
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
X =

     3
    10
     6
    15

</pre>
<p>Note: another useful tip is to use a semi-colon, ;, to suppress the output of a command. Try it here:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">Y = A(:,3);
</pre>
<p>Notice that the values of <tt>Y</tt> did not come up on the screen. But - look in the <i>Workspace</i> window off to the left. <tt>Y</tt> now exists as a variable. Type <tt>Y</tt> at the command prompt:</p>
<h2 id="64">5. Arithmetic Operations on Arrays</h2>
<p>Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between an array and a scalar (a single number) are straightforward. If we add an array and a scalar, every element in the array is added to that scalar: the ith element of the sum of the array M and the scalar a is M(i)+a.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M = [1 3 -0.5 7];
M2 = M+1
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M2 =

    2.0000    4.0000    0.5000    8.0000

</pre>
<p>Similarly, we can subtract, multiply by, and divide by a scalar.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">M3 = 3*M
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M3 =

    3.0000    9.0000   -1.5000   21.0000

</pre>
<pre class="codeinput">M4 = M/10
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
M4 =

    0.1000    0.3000   -0.0500    0.7000

</pre>
<p>It's even possible to add, subtract, multiply and divide arrays with other arrays - but we have to be careful doing this. In particular, we can only do these things between arrays of the same size: that is, we can't add a 5-element array to a 10-element array.</p>
<p>If the arrays are the same size, these arithmetic operations are straightforward. For example, the sum of the N-element array a and the N-element array b is an N-element array whose ith element is</p>
<p>a(i)+b(i)</p>
<pre class="codeinput">a = [1 2 3];
b = [2 -1 4];
c = a+b;
c
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
c =

     3     1     7

</pre>
<p>That is, addition is element-wise. It's just the same with subtraction.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">d = a-b;
d
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
d =

    -1     3    -1

</pre>
<p>With multiplication we use a somewhat different notation. Mathematics defines a special kind of multiplication between arrays - matrix multiplication - which is not what we're doing here. However, it's what MATLAB thinks you're doing if you use the * sign between arrays. To multiply arrays element-wise (like with addition), we need to use the .* notation (note the "." before the "*") (also called the dot-product):</p>
<pre class="codeinput">e = a.*b;
e
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
e =

     2    -2    12

</pre>
<p>Similarly, to divide, we don't use /, but rather ./</p>
<pre class="codeinput">f = a./b;
f
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
f =

    0.5000   -2.0000    0.7500

</pre>
<p>One way to make a matrix is to just type it in... but that could get boring with large data sets. Another way is to <i>concatenate</i> smaller matrices together.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">Z = [X Y]

Z = [2*X X]
</pre>
<pre class="codeoutput">
Z =

     3     2
    10    11
     6     7
    15    16


Z =

     6     3
    20    10
    12     6
    30    15

</pre>
<h2 id="72">6. Creating matrices</h2>
<p>There are a few special commands that allow you to quickly make matrices of a particular size:</p>
<pre class="language-matlab">zeros(m,n) creates <span class="string">an</span> <span class="string">m</span> <span class="string">x</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">matrix</span> <span class="string">of</span> <span class="string">zeros</span>;
ones(m,n) creates <span class="string">an</span> <span class="string">m</span> <span class="string">x</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">matrix</span> <span class="string">of</span> <span class="string">ones</span>;
eye(n) creates <span class="string">the</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">x</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">identity</span> <span class="string">matrix</span>;
diag(v) (assuming v is an n-vector) creates <span class="string">an</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">x</span> <span class="string">n</span> <span class="string">diagonal</span> <span class="string">matrix</span> <span class="string">with</span> <span class="string">v</span> <span class="string">on</span> <span class="string">the</span> <span class="string">diagonal.</span>
</pre>
<p>The commands <tt>zeros</tt> and <tt>ones</tt> can be given any number of integer arguments; with k arguments, they each create a k-dimensional array of the indicated size.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<pre>   max(x) returns the largest entry of x, if x is a vector; see help max for the result when x is a k-dimensional array;
   min(x) analogous to max;
   abs(x) returns an array of the same size as x whose entries are the magnitudes of the entries of x;
   size(A) returns a 1 x k vector with the number of rows, columns, etc. of the k-dimensional array A;
   length(x) returns the ``length'' of the array, i.e. max(size(A)).
   exit exits Matlab</pre>
<p>We can also <tt>load</tt> data into MATLAB from many formats. We will often use <i>mat</i> files which contain matrices previously generated in MATLAB. You can also import text data using the Import Data wizard. We will start using <tt>load</tt> next lab, but feel free to investigate all the options today. Don't worry - you can't break MATLAB - try out the various menu options!</p>
<h2 id="76">7. Simple Graphs</h2>
<p>The simplest graphs to create are plots of points in the cartesian plane. For example:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">x = [1;2;3;4;5];
y = [0;.25;3;1.5;2];
plot(x,y)
</pre>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lab1_01.png" alt=""> <p>Notice that, by default, Matlab connects the points with straight line segments. An alternative is the following:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">plot(x,y,<span class="string">'o'</span>)
</pre>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lab1_02.png" alt=""> <p>Next lab we will learn much more about graphing. If you want to work ahead, try to figure out how to label the axes of your graph (commands <tt>xlabel</tt> and <tt>ylabel</tt> will be useful here) and how to make your graph in "oceanographic format", with depth increasing downwards on the y-axis. Use the <tt>help plot</tt> command for more information.</p>
<pre class="codeinput">xlabel(<span class="string">'name of the x axis'</span>)
ylabel(<span class="string">'name of the y axis'</span>)
</pre>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lab1_03.png" alt=""> <h2 id="79">8. Scripts</h2>
<p>A script is simply a collection of Matlab commands in an m-file (a text file whose name ends in the extension .m). Upon typing the name of the file (without the extension), those commands are executed as if they had been entered in the command window one at a time. The m-file must be located in one of the directories in which Matlab automatically looks for m-files; a list of these directories can be obtained by the command path. (See <tt>help path</tt> to learn how to add a directory to this list.) One of the directories in which Matlab always looks is the current working directory; the command <tt>cd</tt> identifies the current working directory - you can also look on the top status bar of your MATLAB window.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that plotsin.m contains the lines</p>
<pre class="language-matlab">x = 0:2*pi/N:2*pi;
y = sin(w*x);
plot(x,y)
</pre>
<p>Then the sequence of commands below will produce the following figure:</p>
<pre class="codeinput">N=100;w=5;
plotsin
</pre>
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lab1_04.png" alt=""> <h2 id="82">Lab 1 Assignment: Practice using Matrices</h2>
<p>The following questions are designed to test your comphrension of the tutorials. Create a new script in the Editor window and save it as Lab1CodeYourLastName.m . Cut and paste the following questions into your script. In the space under the question, type in the commands that will produce the answers. You can test your code by "running your script" - which means the computer will do all the commands in the code and hopefully your answers will pop up on the screen!

%% Lab 1: Introduction to MATLAB

%% Objective
% The objective of this lab is to get you started using the MATLAB
% computer program. MATLAB is widely used software, and it can be used
% to solve a variety of numerical problems, from solving equations to
% plotting graphs, fitting curves to data points, and processing
% statistical data.
%
%% Source
% You should be able to open and edit the file that made this html
% document. From within MATLAB, open Lab1.m (Do not just double-click the
% file from an Explorer window). You may either type |edit Lab1.m| at the
% command line or you can double-click on the filename in the _Workspace_
% window. This kind of file is sometimes called an "m-file" or a "script".
% It is a series of instructions that the computer will follow. Any line
% that starts with a % is ignored by the program. We use these lines as
% "comment" lines, to allow us to annotate the code with words so we can
% easily see what each section does. 

%%
% During the labs, you will likely need to keep 2 programs running: MATLAB
% (icon on desktop) and a browser set to the webpage
% for the lab. For an internet browser, we suggest Chrome, Safari or Firefox over Microsoft Edge. 
% You may also wish to look at the online MATLAB tutorial
% pages at http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html

%% 1: Online tutorials
%
% Mathworks has some great tutorials on getting started with MATLAB.  
% See http://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials/launchpad.html
% and 
% http://www.mathworks.com/academia/students.html
%
%%
%% 2. Arithmetic Operations and Functions 
%
% At its simplest, we can use MATLAB as a calculator.  In the command
% window, at the command prompt, type
%
% 3+2
%
% What do you get?

3+2

%%
% Type
% 
% 3*7
%
% What do you get?

3*7

%%
% We can also do more complicated operations, like taking exponents:
% for "3 squared" type 
%
% 3^2

3^2

%%
% For "two to the fourth power" type
%
% 2^4

2^4

%% 
% "Scientific notation" is expressed with "10^" replaced by "e" - that is, 10^7 is
% written 1e7 and 2.15x10^-3 is written 2.15e-3.  Examples:
1.5e-2
%%
2e-3 * 1000

%%
% MATLAB has all of the basic arithmetic operations built in:
%
%           +   addition
%           -   subtraction
%           *   multiplication
%           /   division
%           ^   exponentiation
%
% as well as many more complicated functions (e.g. trigonometric,
% exponential):
%
%           sin(x)  sine of x (in radians)
%           cos(x)  cosine of x (in radians)
%           exp(x)  exponential of x
%           log(x)  base e logarithm of x (normally written ln)
%
% The above are just a sample - MATLAB has lots of built-in functions.
%
% You can always get help in MATLAB by typing "help".  Type this alone and
% you'll get a big list of directories you can get more information 
% about - not always too useful.  It's more useful to type
% "help" with some other command that you'd like to know more about.
% E.g.:

help sin
%%
help atan

%%
% You can get a list of all the built-in functions by typing 
%

help elfun


%% 3. Variables In MATLAB
%
% MATLAB can be used like a calculator - but it's much more.  It's also a
% programming language, with all of the basic components of any such
% language.
%
% The first and most basic of these components is one that we use all the
% time in math - the variable.  Like in math, variables are generally
% denoted symbolically by individual characters (like "a" or "x") or by strings of
% characters (like "var1" or "new_value").
%
% Any numerical quantity given a symbolic "name" is a variable. NOTE:
% Variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE; that is, "myvariable" is a different
% name than "MyVariable"
%
% How do we assign a value to a variable?  Easy - just use the equality
% sign.  For example
%
a = 3
%% 
% sets the value 3 to the variable a.
% As another example
b = 2
%%
% sets the value 2 to the variable b.
% We can carry out mathematical operations with these variables: e.g.
%
a+b
%%
a*b
%%
a^b
%%
cos(a)
%%
% There are some built in variables; one of the most useful is pi:

pi
%%
% We can also assign the output of a function to a new variable: e.g.
%
b = a*exp(a)
%%
b
%%
% If you just want MATLAB to assign the value of a calculation to a
% variable without telling you the answer right away, all you have to do is
% put a semicolon after the calculation:
b = a*exp(a);  % note: the semicolon at the end surpressed the output
%%
b
%%
% Being able to use variables is very convenient, particularly when you're
% doing a multi-step calculation with the same quantity and want to be able
% to change the value.  For example:
a = 1;
b = 3*a;
c = a*b^2;
d = c*b-a;
%%
d
%%
% Now say I want to do the same calculation with a = 3; all I need to do is
% make one change
a = 3;
b = 3*a;
c = a*b^2;
d = c*b-a;
%%
% How does this make things any easier?  Well, it didn't really here - we
% still had to type out the equations for b, c, and d all over again.  But
% we'll see that in a stand-alone computer program it's very useful to be able to
% do this.
%
% In fact, the sequence of operations above is an example of a computer
% program.  Operations are carried out in a particular order, with the
% results of earlier computations being fed into later ones. You will be
% writing your own programs in a later section of the tutorial.
%
% It is very important to understand this *sequential structure* of
% programming.  In a program, things happen in a very particular order: the
% order you tell them to happen.  It's very important to make sure you get
% this order right.  This is pretty straightforward in the above example, but can
% be much more complicated! (see Lab 5, Flow Control)
%
% Any time a variable is created, it's kept in memory.  This can be useful
% - you can always use the variable again later.  It can also make things
% harder - for example, in a long program you may try giving a variable a
% name that you've given another one earlier in the program, leading to
% confusion.

% Let's see what is MATLABs memory by typing
whos
%%
% or, you can look in the _Workspace_ window.  
%
%%
% It can therefore be useful sometimes make MATLAB forget about a variable; for
% this the |clear| command is used.  For example, define
b = 3;
%%
% Now if we ask what b is, we'll get back that it's 3
b
%% 
% Using the clear command to remove b from memory
clear b
%%
% now if we ask about b
%
% b
%
% ??? Undefined function or variable 'b'.
%%
% we're told it's not a variable in memory - we've succeeded in getting rid
% of it.  To get rid of everything in memory, just type
clear all

%%
% Have a look over in the _Workspace_ corner of your MATLAB window. All the
% variables we've already created are gone!



%% 4: Matrices / Arrays
%
% An important idea in programming is that of an array (or matrix).  This is just an
% ordered sequence of numbers (known as elements):

x = [1;2;3]

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 0]

% Notice that the rows of a matrix are separated by semicolons, while the
% entries on a row are separated by spaces (or commas).
%%
M = [1 22 -0.4]
%%
% M = [1, 22, -0.4] is a 3-element
% array in which the first element is 1, the second element is 22, and the
% third element is -0.4.  These are ordered - in this particular array, these numbers
% always occur in this sequence - but this doesn't mean that there's any
% particular structure to the ordering.  That is - in an array, numbers
% don't have to increase or decrease or anything like that.  The elements can
% be in any order - but that order partly defines the array.  Also note that
% the numbers can be integers or rational numbers, or positive or negative.
%
% While the elements of the array can be any kind of number, their
% positions are identified by integers: there is a first, a second, a third,
% a fourth, etc. up until the end of the array.  It's standard to indicate
% the position of the array using bracket notation: in the above example, 
% the first element is
%
% M(1) = 1
%
% the second element is 
%
% M(2) = 22 
% 
% and the third element is
%
% M(3) = -0.4.  
%
% These integers counting off position in the array are known as "indices"
% (singular is "index").
%
% All programming languages use arrays, but MATLAB is designed to make them
% particularly easy to work with (the MAT is for "matrix").  To make the
% array above in MATLAB all you need to do is type

M = [1 22 -0.4]
%%
% To enter a matrix, just follow a few basic conventions:
%
% * separate the elements of a row with blanks or commas
%
% * use a semicolon, ;, to indicate the end of each row
%
% * Surround the entire list of elements with square brackets, [ ].
%
% * Remember that MATLAB always looks at rows first, then columns. 

%%
% Then to look at individual elements of the array, just ask for them by
% index number:

M(1)
%%
M(2)
%%
M(3)
%%
%
% We can also ask for certain ranges of an array, using the "colon" operator.
% For an array M we can ask for element i through element j by typing 
%
% M(i:j)
%
% E.g.:
M(1:2)
%%
M(2:3)
%%
% If we want all elements of the array, we can type the colon on its own
M(:)
%%
% We can also use this notation to make arrays with a particular structure.
% Typing 
%
% M = a:b:c 
% 
% makes an array that starts with first element 
%
% M(1)=a 
%
% and
% increases with increment b: 
%
% M(2) = a+b, M(3)= a+2b, M(4) = a+3b, etc.
%
% The array stops at the largest value of N for which M(N) <= c.
%
% Example 1:

M = 1:1:3

%%
% The array starts with 1, increases by 1, and ends at 3
% 
% Example 2:

M = [1 : 0.5 : 3]

%%
% The array starts at 1, increases by 0.5, and ends at 3
%
% Example 3:
M = [1:0.6:3]
%%
% Here the array starts at 1, increases by 0.6, and ends at 2.8 - because
% making one more step in the array would make the last element bigger than
% 3.
%
% Example 4:
M = [3:-0.5:1]
%%
% This kind of array can also be decreasing.
%
% If the increment size b isn't specified, a default value of 1 is used:
M = [1:5]
%%
% That is, the array a:c is the same as the array a:1:c
%%
% It is important to note that while the elements of an array can be any kind of 
% number, the indices must be positive integers (1 and bigger).  Trying
% non-positive or fractional integers will result in an error message. (Try
% it ...)
%
% Each of the elements of an array is a variable on its own, which can be used 
% in a mathematical operation.  E.g.:

M(1)+M(3)

%%

M(2)*M(3)

%%
% The array itself is also a kind of variable - an array variable.  We need to
% be careful with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
% multiplication, division, exponentiaion) when it comes to arrays - these
% things have to be defined correctly.  We'll look at this later.
%
% In MATLAB, when most functions are fed an array as an argument they give
% back an array of the function acting on each element.  That is, for the
% function f and the array M, f(M) is an array such that 
%
% f(i) = f(M(i)).
%
% E.g. 
a = 0:4
b = exp(a)
%%
% Let's now try a 2-dimensional array. Type the following command into the
% command window: 
A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 16 1]

%% 
% MATLAB displays the matrix you just entered. We named this matrix |A| and
% it is now stored in the _Workspace_. 
%%
% *Subscripts* The element in row |i| and column |j| of |A| is denoted by
% |A(i,j)|. For example, |A(4,2)| is the number in the 4th row and the 2nd
% column. What is the value at |A(4,2)|? Type the command at the command
% prompt. 
A(4,2)

%%
% What if we want a list of all the elements in the 2nd column? We use the
% colon, :, to indicate all the row values (in this case). 
A(:,2)

%%
% When you do not specify an output variable, MATLAB uses the variable
% |ans|, short for _answer_, to store the results of a calculation. |ans|
% will get over-written each time you do not specify an output variable. 
%%
% Let's make a new matrix called |X| (also known as a vector if it only has
% one column) that has only the values from the 2nd column of A.
X = A(:,2)

%%
% Note: another useful tip is to use a semi-colon, ;, to suppress the
% output of a command. Try it here: 
Y = A(:,3);
%%
% Notice that the values of |Y| did not come up on the screen. But - look
% in the _Workspace_ window off to the left. |Y| now exists as a variable. 
% Type |Y| at the command prompt: 

%% 5. Arithmetic Operations on Arrays
%
% Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
% between an array and a scalar (a single number) are straightforward.  If
% we add an array and a scalar, every element in the array is added to that
% scalar: the ith element of the sum of the array M and the scalar a is
% M(i)+a.  

M = [1 3 -0.5 7];
M2 = M+1
%%
% Similarly, we can subtract, multiply by, and divide by a scalar.
%

M3 = 3*M
%%
M4 = M/10
%%
% It's even possible to add, subtract, multiply and divide arrays with
% other arrays - but we have to be careful doing this.  In particular, we can
% only do these things between arrays of the same size: that is, we can't
% add a 5-element array to a 10-element array.
%
% If the arrays are the same size, these arithmetic operations are
% straightforward.  For example, the sum of the N-element array a and the
% N-element array b is an N-element array whose ith element is 
%
% a(i)+b(i)

a = [1 2 3];
b = [2 -1 4];
c = a+b;
c

%%
% That is, addition is element-wise.  It's just the same with subtraction.

d = a-b;
d

%%
% With multiplication we use a somewhat different notation.  Mathematics
% defines a special kind of multiplication between arrays - matrix
% multiplication - which is not what we're doing here.  However, it's what
% MATLAB thinks you're doing if you use the * sign between arrays.  To
% multiply arrays element-wise (like with addition), we need to use the .*
% notation (note the "." before the "*") (also called the dot-product):
e = a.*b;
e
%%
% Similarly, to divide, we don't use /, but rather ./
f = a./b;
f
%%
% One way to make a matrix is to just type it in... but that could get
% boring with large data sets. Another way is to _concatenate_ smaller
% matrices together. 
Z = [X Y]

Z = [2*X X]

%% 6. Creating matrices
% There are a few special commands that allow you to quickly make matrices
% of a particular size: 
%
%   zeros(m,n) creates an m x n matrix of zeros;
%   ones(m,n) creates an m x n matrix of ones;
%   eye(n) creates the n x n identity matrix;
%   diag(v) (assuming v is an n-vector) creates an n x n diagonal matrix with v on the diagonal.

%%
% The commands |zeros| and |ones| can be given any number of integer arguments;
% with k arguments, they each create a k-dimensional array of the indicated
% size.

%%
% Miscellaneous
% 
%     max(x) returns the largest entry of x, if x is a vector; see help max for the result when x is a k-dimensional array;
%     min(x) analogous to max;
%     abs(x) returns an array of the same size as x whose entries are the magnitudes of the entries of x;
%     size(A) returns a 1 x k vector with the number of rows, columns, etc. of the k-dimensional array A;
%     length(x) returns the ``length'' of the array, i.e. max(size(A)).
%     exit exits Matlab
%%
% We can also |load| data into MATLAB from many formats. We will often use
% _mat_ files which contain matrices previously generated in MATLAB. You
% can also import text data using the Import Data wizard. We will start
% using |load| next lab, but feel free to investigate all the options
% today. Don't worry - you can't break MATLAB - try out the various menu
% options!
%% 7. Simple Graphs
%
% The simplest graphs to create are plots of points in the cartesian plane. For example:
x = [1;2;3;4;5];
y = [0;.25;3;1.5;2];
plot(x,y)
%%
% Notice that, by default, Matlab connects the points with straight line
% segments. An alternative is the following:

plot(x,y,'o')
%%
% Next lab we will learn much more about graphing. If you want to work
% ahead, try to figure out how to label the axes of your graph (commands
% |xlabel| and |ylabel| will be useful here) and how to make your graph in
% "oceanographic format", with depth increasing downwards on the y-axis.
% Use the |help plot| command for more information. 

xlabel('name of the x axis')
ylabel('name of the y axis')

%% 8. Scripts 
%
% A script is simply a collection of Matlab commands in an m-file (a text
% file whose name ends in the extension .m). Upon typing the name of the
% file (without the extension), those commands are executed as if they had
% been entered in the command window one at a time. The m-file must be
% located in one of the directories in which Matlab automatically looks for
% m-files; a list of these directories can be obtained by the command path.
% (See |help path| to learn how to add a directory to this list.) One of
% the directories in which Matlab always looks is the current working
% directory; the command |cd| identifies the current working directory -
% you can also look on the top status bar of your MATLAB window.
% 
% For example, suppose that plotsin.m contains the lines
%
%   x = 0:2*pi/N:2*pi;
%   y = sin(w*x);
%   plot(x,y)
%
%%
% Then the sequence of commands below will produce the following figure:
%
N=100;w=5;
plotsin

%%
